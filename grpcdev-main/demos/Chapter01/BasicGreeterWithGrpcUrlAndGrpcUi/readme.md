# The Basics

This demo shows a simple Greeter service and its client, both C#.  
- The Greeter service is the one generated by the gRpc template for .NET Core.
- The client is a simple console application that calls the service.  

To tryout the service without a client, we can use a couple of tools, as described on  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/test-tools?view=aspnetcore-6.0

Download grpcurl from https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/releases

Unzip the archive and copy the grpcurl executable to the directory of the project.

To describe the service, we can use the following command:
```powershell
grpcurl -proto "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos\greet.proto" -import-path "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos" describe
```

To list the available rpc, we can use the following command:
```powershell
grpcurl -proto "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos\greet.proto" -import-path "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos" list
```

To invoke the rpc, we can use the following command (make sure your service is running and use the correct port):
```powershell
grpcurl -proto "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos\greet.proto" -import-path "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos" -d "{\"name\":\"Simona\"}" localhost:7056 greet.Greeter.SayHello 
```

Install the Go Language from here https://go.dev/dl/  
Install grpcui by typing:

```powershell
go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui/cmd/grpcui@latest
```

Now you can use the grpcui to interact with the service (make sure the service is running and use the correct port).
```powershell
grpcui -proto "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos\greet.proto" -import-path "FirstDemo.ServerSide\Protos" localhost:7056 
```

After adding reflection:

```powershell
grpcurl -d "{\"name\":\"Simona\"}" localhost:7056 greet.Greeter.SayHello
```

```powershell
grpcui localhost:7056
```
