## 🧐Description <a name = "Description"></a> 

    gRPC is a language agnostic, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

    The main benefits of gRPC are:

    Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
    Contract-first API development, using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
    Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
    Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
    Reduced network usage with Protobuf binary serialization.
    These benefits make gRPC ideal for:

    Lightweight microservices where efficiency is critical.
    Polyglot systems where multiple languages are required for development.
    Point-to-point real-time services that need to handle streaming requests or responses.

## 🧐Requirements <a name = "Requirements"></a> 

    It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
    for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
    focus on defining the problem.

    - IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. At large, this section
      should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
    - REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product.
    - CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
      This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

    Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
    requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## 💡 Analyse <a name = "Analyse"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
